### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Ellie Jackson (pronouns she/her). I am pursuing a graduate degree at the Unversity of Chicago in Computer Science and Public Policy. I strive to build technology which empower lives. I write code, engage with people, receive their feedback, and then adapt code in an iterative process.
