### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Ellie Jackson (pronouns she/her). I am pursuing a graduate degree at the intersection of computer science and public policy. I program to collaborate with communities and build products which empower lives. I write code, engage with people, receive their feedback, and then adapt code as an iterative process. This is how I work to mindfully reflect people's needs and how a piece of technology integrates into a personâ€™s life.
