### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Ellie Jackson (pronouns she/her). I am pursuing a graduate degree at the intersection of computer science and public policy. I strive to build products which empower lives. I write code, engage with people, receive their feedback, and then adapt code in an iterative process. This is how I work to mindfully reflect people's needs and create a piece of technology that seamlessly integrates into a personâ€™s life.
