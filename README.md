### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Ellie Jackson (pronouns she/her). I will be graduating from the University of Chicago with a Masters degree in Computer Science and Public Policy this June. I strive to build technology which empower lives. I write code, engage with people, receive their feedback, and then adapt code in an iterative process.
